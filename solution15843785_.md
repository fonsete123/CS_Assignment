## Visualization

![Beer vs WO](plot.png)

## Interpretation

The graph shows two time series datasets for the Netherlands between 2006 and 2018:

- The number of university graduates (WO) is steadily increasing.
- Beer consumption remains relatively stable, with a slight upward trend in recent years.

This shows that both trends are increasing, and does not appear to have a negative relationship.
